# Classical Ciphers in Python 🕵️‍♂️🔐

This repository contains Python implementations of several classical encryption algorithms.  
Each script demonstrates the logic behind a specific cipher, often used in historical cryptography.

## 🔒 Implemented Ciphers

- Affine Cipher
- Atbash Cipher
- Beaufort Cipher
- Caesar Cipher
- Gronsfeld Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Polybius Square Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher

## 🧠 Purpose

- Understand the inner workings of classical encryption methods  
- Practice Python through algorithmic implementation  
- Build a reference for educational and cryptographic experiments
