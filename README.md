# Classical Ciphers in Python 🔐
This repository contains Python implementations of several classical encryption algorithms.
Each script demonstrates the logic behind a specific cipher, often used in historical cryptography.

## 🔒 Implemented Ciphers
- Affine Cipher;
- Atbash Cipher;
- Beaufort Cipher;
- Caesar Cipher;
- Gronsfeld Cipher;
- Hill Cipher;
- Playfair Cipher;
- Polybius Square Cipher;
- Rail Fence Cipher;
- Vigenère Cipher.

## 🧠 Purpose
- Understand the inner workings of classical encryption methods;
- Practice Python through algorithmic implementation;
- Build a reference for educational and cryptographic experiments.
